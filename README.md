# Jitsi Joiner App

This app is built using the **Jitsi SDK** that allows users to join meetings by entering a room ID. The app works as a **Joiner**, allowing users to join a meeting created by the host in the **Jitsi app**.

### Features:
- **Joiner Functionality**: Users can join a meeting by entering a room ID created by the host.
- **UI Design**: Simple and clean user interface designed with the help of **AI** for an enhanced user experience.

### App Preview:
Here are a few screenshots showing how the app looks and works:

#### Home Screen:
The home screen allows users to enter the **Room ID** to join a meeting.

### How It Works:

1. **Host Creates a Room**:
   - The host creates a room in the **Jitsi app** and starts the meeting.
   - The **Room ID** is generated for the meeting, which the host shares with the user.

2. **Join the Meeting**:
   - The user opens the **Joiner App**, enters the **Room ID**, and joins the meeting created by the host.
3. For Create Room
 - Jit si Web: https://meet.jit.si/
- Jitsi App Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jitsi.meet&hl=en

> **Note**: To enable the host functionality within the app, **server-side configurations** are required, but due to server access limitations, this part was not implemented. This app currently works only for **joining** meetings.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jitsi-joiner-app.git
